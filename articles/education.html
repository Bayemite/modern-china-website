        Education in China is primarily managed by the state-run public education system,
        which falls under the command of the Ministry of Education. All citizens must
        attend school for a minimum of nine years, known as nine-year compulsory education,
        which is funded by the government. Compulsory education includes six years of primary
        education, typically starting at the age of six or seven, followed by three years of
        junior secondary education (junior middle school).<br>
        Some provinces may have five years
        of primary schooling but four years for junior middle school. Junior middle schooling
        is followed by three years of senior middle school, by the end of which secondary education is completed.

    <p class="center-paragraph">
        <abbr title="中华人民共和国义务教育法">
            The Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education</abbr>,
        which took effect on July 1, 1986, established requirements and deadlines
        for attaining universal education tailored to local conditions and guaranteed
        school-age children the right to receive at least nine years of education
        (six-year primary education and three years secondary education).<br>
        People's congresses at various local levels were, within certain guidelines and according
        to local conditions, to decide the steps, methods, and deadlines for implementing
        nine-year compulsory education in accordance with the guidelines formulated by the
        central authorities. The program sought to bring rural areas, which had four to six
        years of compulsory schooling, into line with their urban counterparts. Education
        departments were exhorted to train millions of skilled workers for all trades and
        professions and to offer guidelines, curricula, and methods to comply with the reform
        program and modernization needs.
        <br><br>
        Provincial-level authorities were to develop plans, enact decrees and rules,
        distribute funds to counties, and administer directly a few key secondary schools.
        County authorities were to distribute funds to each township government, which was
        to make up for any deficiencies. County authorities were to supervise education and
        teaching and to manage their own senior middle schools, teachers' schools, teachers'
        in-service training schools, agricultural vocational schools, and exemplary primary and
        junior middle schools. The remaining schools were to be managed separately by the county and township
        authorities.
        <br><br>
        The compulsory education law divided China into three categories: cities and economically developed
        areas in coastal provinces and a small number of developed areas in the hinterland; towns and villages
        with medium development; and economically backward areas.
        <br><br>
        By November 1985 the first category - the larger cities and approximately 20 percent of the counties (mainly in
        the more developed coastal and southeastern areas of China) had achieved universal 9-year education. By 1990
        cities, economically developed areas in coastal provincial-level units, and a small number of developed interior
        areas (approximately 25 percent of China's population) and areas where junior middle schools were already
        popularized were targeted to have universal junior-middle-school education. Education planners had envisioned
        that by the mid-1990s all workers and staff in coastal areas, inland cities, and moderately developed areas
        (with a combined population of 300 million to 400 million people) would have either compulsory 9-year or
        vocational education and that 5 percent of the people in these areas would have a college education - building a
        solid intellectual foundation for China. Further, the planners expected that secondary education and university
        entrants would have increased by the year 2000.
        <br><br>
        The second category targeted under the 9-year compulsory education law consisted of towns and villages with
        medium-level development (around 50 percent of China's population), where universal education was expected to
        reach the junior-middle-school level by 1995. Technical and higher education was projected to develop at the
        same rate.
        <br><br>
        The third category, economically backward (rural) areas (around 25 percent of China's population ) were to
        popularize basic education without a timetable and at various levels according to local economic development,
        though the state would try to support educational development. The state also would assist education in minority
        nationality areas. In the past, rural areas, which lacked a standardized and universal primary education system,
        had produced generations of illiterates; only 60 percent of their primary school graduates had met established
        standards.
        <br><br>
        As a further example of the government's commitment to nine-year compulsory education, in January 1986 the State
        Council drafted a bill passed at the Fourteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Sixth National People's
        Congress that made it illegal for any organization or individual to employ youths before they had completed
        their nine years of schooling.[33] The bill also authorized free education and subsidies for students whose
        families had financial difficulties.
        <br><br>
        Tuition-free primary education is, despite compulsory education laws, still a target rather than a realized goal
        throughout China. As many families have difficulty paying school fees, some children are forced to leave school
        earlier than the nine-year goal.
        <br><br>
        The 9-year System is called "Nine Years - One Policy", or "九年一贯制" in Chinese. It usually refers to the
        educational integration of the elementary school and the middle school. After graduating from elementary school,
        graduates can directly enter into the junior middle school. The grades in schools that implement the 9-year
        System are usually called Grade 1, Grade 2, and so on through Grade 9.

        Main features of the 9-year System:
        <ol>
            <li>Continuity. Students finish education from the elementary school to the middle school.</li>
            <li>The principle of proximity. Students enter into the nearby school instead of middle school entrance
                examination.</li>
            <li>Unity. Schools that carry out the 9-year System practice unified management in school administration,
                teaching and education.</li>
        </ol>

        is a country in East Asia.
        It is the world's most populous country, with a population of around 1.4 billion in 2019.
        Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometres, it is the world's third or fourth-largest
        country by area. Governed by the Communist Party of China, the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces,
        five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the
        special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.

    <h3 class="subTitle-center" id="end-of-imperial-china">End of Imperial China</h3>
    <p class="center-paragraph">
        On 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, 
        and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed
        provisional president.<br>
        However, the presidency was later given to Yuan Shikai,
        a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face
        of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to
        abdicate and re-establish the republic.<br><br>

        After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based 
        government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords
        controlled most of its territory. In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang, under 
        Chiang Kai-shek, the then Principal of the Republic of China Military Academy, was 
        able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political
        manoeuvrings, known collectively as the Northern Expedition. <br>
        The Kuomintang moved the
        nation's capital to Nanjing and implemented "political tutelage", an intermediate stage of 
        political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's San-min program for transforming China into
        a modern democratic state.<br><br>

        The political division in China made it difficult for Chiang 
        to battle the communist People's Liberation Army (PLA), against whom the Kuomintang had been
        warring since 1927 in the Chinese Civil War. This war continued successfully for the Kuomintang,
        especially after the PLA retreated in the Long March, until Japanese aggression and the 1936
        Xi'an Incident forced Chiang to confront Imperial Japan.<br><br>

        The Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), a theater of World War II, forced an uneasy alliance 
        between the Kuomintang and the PLA.<br>
         Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against
        the civilian population; in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died. An estimated
        40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were massacred in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation.<br><br>

        During the war, China, along with the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union, were referred to as 
        "trusteeship of the powerful" and were recognized as the Allied "Big Four" in the Declaration
        by United Nations. <br>
        Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four 
        major Allies of World War II, and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war.
        After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the Pescadores, was returned 
        to Chinese control. China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. 
        The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war.
        Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions 
        of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China.

    <p class="center-paragraph">
        Major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with the Communist Party in control of 
        most of mainland China, and the Kuomintang retreating offshore, reducing its territory to only 
        Taiwan, Hainan, and their surrounding islands. On 21 September 1949, Communist Party Chairman Mao
        Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China with a speech at the First
        Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference[89][90][91] followed 
        by a public proclamation and celebration in Tiananmen Square.[92] In 1950, the People's Liberation 
        Army captured Hainan from the ROC[93] and incorporated Tibet.[94] However, remaining Kuomintang forces
        continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.[95]

        <br><br>
        The regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform, which 
        included the execution of between 1 and 2 million landlords.[96] China developed an independent
        industrial system and its own nuclear weapons.[97] The Chinese population increased from 550 million 
        in 1950 to 900 million in 1974.[98] However, the Great Leap Forward, an idealistic massive reform project,
        resulted in an estimated 15 to 35 million deaths between 1958 and 1961, mostly from starvation.[99][100][101]
        In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution, sparking a decade of political recrimination 
        and social upheaval that lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In October 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic in 
        the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.[102]

    <h3 class="subTitle-center" id="economic-reforms">Economic Reforms</h3>
    <p class="center-paragraph">
        Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China's economy has been one of the world's
         fastest-growing with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. <br>
         According to the World Bank, China's 
         <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr>
         grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. Since 2010, China has been the world's second-largest economy by 
         nominal GDP, and since 2014, the largest economy in the world by <abbr title="Purchasing Power Parity">PPP</abbr>.<br>
         China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods. 
         China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army, 
         the People's Liberation Army, and the second-largest defense budget. The 
         <abbr title="People's Republic of China">PRC</abbr>
          is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since replacing the 
          <abbr title="Republic of China">ROC</abbr> 
          in 1971. China has been characterized as a emerging superpower, mainly because of its massive population, 
          large and rapidly-growing
         economy, and powerful military.</p>

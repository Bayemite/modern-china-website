    <p class="center-paragraph">
        China was once a world leader in science and technology up until the Ming dynasty. <br>
        Ancient Chinese discoveries and inventions,
        such as papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder (the Four Great Inventions),
        became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later to Europe.
        Chinese mathematicians
        were the first to use negative numbers.<br><br>
        However, by the 17th century, Europe and the Western
        world surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement. The causes of this early
        modern Great Divergence continue to be debated by scholars to this day.

        After repeated military defeats by the European colonial powers and Japan in the 19th century,
        Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Self-Strengthening Movement.
        <br><br>
        After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the
        model of the Soviet Union, in which scientific research was part of central planning. After Mao's death in
        1976, science and technology was established as one of the Four Modernizations, and the Soviet-inspired
        academic system was gradually reformed.

    <p class="center-paragraph">
        Since the end of the Cultural Revolution,
        China has made significant investments in scientific research
        and is quickly catching up with the US in R&D spending.<br>
        In 2017,
        China spent $279 billion on scientific research and development.
        According to the OECD, China spent 2.11% of its GDP on research and development
        (R&D) in 2016. Science and technology are seen as vital for achieving China's
        economic and political goals, and are held as a source of national pride to a degree
        sometimes described as "techno-nationalism". <br>
        Also in 2017, China was No. 2 in international
        patents application, behind the US but ahead of Japan. Chinese tech companies Huawei
        and ZTE were the top 2 filers of international patents in 2017. Chinese-born scientists
        have won the Nobel Prize in Physics four times, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Physiology or
        Medicine once respectively, though most of these scientists conducted their Nobel-winning research
        in western nations.
        <br><br>
        China is developing its education system with an emphasis on science, mathematics and engineering;
        in 2009, China graduated over 10,000 PhD engineers, and as many as 500,000 BSc graduates, more than
        any other country. China also became the world's largest publisher of scientific papers in 2016.<br>
        Chinese technology companies such as Huawei and Lenovo have become world leaders in telecommunications
        and personal computing, and Chinese supercomputers are consistently ranked among the world's
        most powerful. China has been the world's largest market for industrial robots since 2013 and will
        account for 45% of newly installed robots from 2019–2021.

        The Chinese space program is one of the world's most active. <br>
        In 1970, China launched its first satellite, Dong Fang Hong I,
        becoming the fifth country to do so independently.<br>
        In 2003, China became the third country to independently send
        humans into space, with Yang Liwei's spaceflight aboard Shenzhou 5; as of 2015, ten Chinese nationals have
        journeyed
        into space, including two women. <br>
        In 2011, China's first space station module, Tiangong-1, was launched, marking the
        first step in a project to assemble a large manned station by the early 2020s.<br>
        In 2013, China successfully landed
        the Chang'e 3 lander and Yutu rover onto the lunar surface.<br>
        In 2019, China became the first country to land a
        probe—Chang'e 4—on the far side of the moon.
